# MonkeStatistics
A simple player statistic tracker for Gorilla Tag.
## Installation
To install this mod, drag and drop the contents of the ZIP file into your Gorilla Tag folder.
## For Developer
Please note this mod is mainly designed for showing statistics the buttons are suppose to be a secondary feature. But lets begin.
### Settings up
To start your project, add MonkeStatistics as a BepInEx dependencies. ``[BepInDependency("Crafterbot.MonkeStatistics")]`` Then add
MonkeStatistics as a dependencies in Visual Studios(or your preferred IDE). To ensure it is added correctly, in your main file reference it at ``using MonkeStatistics.API``. If there is a red line under that statement, trouble shoot or something.
### Getting started
To register your plugin to MonkeStatistics, execute the following method. ``MonkeStatistics.API.Registry.AddAssembly();`` This method must be execute before the ``GorillaLocomotion.Player.instance`` is defined. So I would recommend executing it on your projects ``Awake`` method.
### Writing a basic page
Now it is time to write a page. What is a page? A page is a group of lines that can be used to show information to a player. Each line can have one button. The button can ether be a toggle button, or a standard click button.
```cs
    [DisplayInMainMenu("My Displayname")] // If this attribute is here, this page will be on the main menu.
    internal class MyPage : Page
    {
        public override void OnPageOpen() // this method will execute when this page is opened through the UIManager
        {
            TextLines = new Dictionary<string, ButtonInfo>()
            {
                {"Player Name", null }, // if the button info is null, there will be no button on that line.
                { "Kills", new ButtonInfo(EventMethod_handler, 0, false, false) },
            };
            SetTitle("Gorilla Scoreboard"); // sets the title field
            SetAuthor(""); // sets the author field
            SetLines(); // sets all lines as TextLines. 
        }

        private void EventMethod_handler(object Sender, object[] Args)
        {
          int ReturnId = (int)Args[0];
          bool IsOn = (bool)Args[1];
          bool IsToggleButton = (ButtonType)Args[2]; // button type
        }
    }
```
