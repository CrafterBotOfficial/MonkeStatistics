# Introduction

MonkeStatistics works by giving each page a list of 10 lines that they can edit however is needed. For convenience you can use the [PageBuilder](api/MonkeStatistics.UI.PageBuilder.html) and [ScrollPageBuilder](/api/MonkeStatistics.UI.ScrollPageBuilder.html) to help with that process.
